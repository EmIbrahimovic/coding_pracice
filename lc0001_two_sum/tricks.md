# LeetCode 1. Two Sum

coded a so called [[two-pass hash map]] at first

then once that got accepted but was worse than other people's, updated to one-pass

> maybe i shouldn't be satisfied with that - trying to improve my own solution on its own merit - that's how progress is made

## approach lessons

* 

## cpp code optimization lessons

* [[unordered_map]] seems to be faster than [[map]]
* you can create [[vector]]s with `{0, 1, 2}` or `{}`
